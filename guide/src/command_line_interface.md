## Main commands

### `creusot`

```
cargo creusot [-- [-p <CRATE>]]
```

Run the Creusot compiler.

Output Coma code in the `verif/` directory.

#### Options

- `-p <CRATE>`: Compile a specific crate `<CRATE>` in a multi-crate project.

### `prove`

```
cargo creusot prove [-i] [<COMA_FILE>]
```

Verify contracts.

This first runs `cargo creusot` to be sure that the compiled code is up-to-date.
Then `why3find` verifies the compiled Coma code: it generates verification conditions
and tries to prove them.

#### Options

- `-i`: Open the Why3 IDE on an unproved file to inspect its proof context.
- `<COMA_FILE>`: Verify a specific file (corresponding to one Rust function).

### `doc`

```
cargo creusot doc
```

Build documentation.

This is a variant of `cargo doc` that also renders contracts (`requires` and `ensures`), logic functions, and predicates.


### `clean`

```
cargo creusot clean [--force] [--dry-run]
```

Remove dangling proof files.

Removing (or renaming) Rust functions also removes (or renames) its compiled Coma file.
However, the Creusot compiler can't keep track of their associated proof files (`proof.json`, `why3session.xml`), which become dangling.
`cargo creusot` will detect dangling files and print a warning to remind you to move those files if you want,
otherwise you can remove them with `cargo creusot clean`.

#### Options

- `--force`: Don't ask for confirmation before removing dangling files.
- `--dry-run`: Only print the list of files that would be removed by `cargo creusot clean`.

## Create package

### `new`

```
cargo creusot new <NAME> [--main]
```

Create package named `<NAME>`.

Create a directory `<NAME>` and initialize it with starting configuration and source files.

#### Options

- `--main`: Create `main.rs` for an executable crate. (By default, only a library crate `lib.rs` is created.)

### `init`

```
cargo creusot init [<NAME>] [--main]
```

Create package in the current directory.

#### Options

- `<NAME>`: Name of the package. (By default, it is the name of the directory.)
- `--main`: Create `main.rs` for an executable crate. (By default, only a library crate `lib.rs` is created.)

### `config`

```
cargo creusot config
```

Generate `why3find` configuration.

This is used to set up Creusot in an existing Rust package.
You don't need to run this command if you used `cargo creusot new` or `cargo creusot init`.

## Install Creusot

### `setup install`

```
cargo creusot setup install
```

See the [README](https://github.com/creusot-rs/creusot) for installation instructions.

### `setup status`

```
cargo creusot setup status
```

Show the status of the Creusot installation.

Print tool locations and configuration paths.
