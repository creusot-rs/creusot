# Variants

A `variant` clause can be attached either to a function like `ensures`, or `requires` or to a loop like `invariant`, it should contain a strictly decreasing expression which can prove the termination of the item it is attached to.

<!-- TODO: be more precise:
- where exactly is `variant` allowed ?
- At least one example -->
