/// Define a _Resource Algebra_.
///
/// Resource algebras are a concept inspired by [Iris](https://iris-project.org/). Used in
/// conjunction with [`Resource`](crate::resource::Resource)s, they unlock new reasonings.
///
/// # Notes on the definition of resource algebras
///
/// Our definition of resource algebras differs from the one in Iris in that it
/// does not require RAs to define a "core" function. Instead, we follow "Idempotent
/// Resources in Separation Logic --- The Heart of core in Iris" by Gratzer, MÃ¸ller &
/// Birkedal (GMB), and require RAs to satisfy a "maximal idempotent" axiom.
///
/// We allow RAs to contain junk values and equip RAs with a validity predicate. This
/// is unlike the paper definitions of GMB (who instead take `op` to be a partial
/// function), but like in Iris and the Iris mechanization of GMB (cf the artifact of
/// the paper). This is because Creusot does not support subset types in the logic,
/// which would be required to define e.g. the Auth RA if we were to disallow junk
/// values. (The Iris formalization also makes this choice for practical formalization
/// reasons, as far as we know.)
/// The downside is that junk values pollute the definition of some RAs and higher-order
/// order agreement is harder to define (according to GMB, but we only need first-order
/// agreement in Creusot anyway). On the plus side, working with a total `op` instead of
/// chaining operations in the Option monad is often nicer.
pub trait RA: Sized {
    /// The operation of this resource algebra.
    ///
    /// This is the core of the trait. This operation will be used to [`join`](crate::resource::Resource::join)
    /// and [`split`](crate::resource::Resource::split) resources.
    ///
    /// It must be [associative](Self::associative) and [commutative](Self::commutative)
    /// (among others).

    // We allow the implementor to give a custom definition, that is possibly

    // will be used to prove the RA laws.

    /// Inclusion of RA.
    ///
    /// This asserts that `other` is, in a sense, 'bigger' than `self`.
    ///
    /// # Notes on reflexivity
    ///
    /// Following Iris, our definition of `incl` is not reflexive.
    /// We could define it to be `self == other || ...`, but doing that
    /// loses the following desirable property for the product RA:
    ///
    /// ```text
    /// (x, y).incl((x', y')) == x.incl(x') && y.incl(y').
    /// ```
    ///
    /// If you need the reflexive closure of the inclusion relation, then
    /// you can use `Some(x).incl(Some(y))`. Indeed, `incl` on the Option RA
    /// has the following property:
    ///
    /// ```text
    /// Some(x).incl(Some(y)) == (x == y || x.incl(y))
    /// ```
    ///
    /// Note that the paper on the maximal idempotent axiom (GMB) uses the
    /// reflexive definition of `incl` on paper, but not in its accompanying
    /// Iris formalization, where it uses the non-reflexive definition (as
    /// we do here).
