//! The "standard library" of Creusot.
//!
//! To start using Creusot, you should always import that crate. The recommended way is
//! to have a glob import:
//!
//! ```
//! use creusot_contracts::*;
//! ```
//!
//! # Writing specifications
//!
//! To start writing specification, use the [`requires`] and [`ensures`] macros:
//!
//! ```
//! use creusot_contracts::*;
//!
//! #[requires(x < i32::MAX)]
//! #[ensures(result@ == x@ + 1)]
//! fn add_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
//!     x + 1
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! For a more detailed explanation, see the [guide](https://creusot-rs.github.io/creusot/guide).
