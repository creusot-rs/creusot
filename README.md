# About

**Creusot** is a *deductive verifier* for Rust code. It verifies your code is safe from panics, overflows, and assertion failures. By adding annotations you can take it further and verify your code does the *correct* thing.

Creusot works by translating Rust code to WhyML, the verification and specification language of [Why3](https://www.why3.org). Users can then leverage the full power of Why3 to (semi)-automatically discharge the verification conditions!

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for technical details.

## Help and Discussions

If you need help using Creusot or would like to discuss, you can post on the [discussions forum](https://github.com/creusot-rs/creusot/discussions) or join our [Zulip chat](https://why3.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/341707-creusot)!

## Citing Creusot

If you would like to cite Creusot in academic contexts, we encourage you to use our [ICFEM'22 publication](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-03737878/file/main.pdf).

# Examples of Verification

To get an idea of what verifying a program with Creusot looks like, we encourage you to take a look at some of our test suite:

- [Zeroing out a vector](creusot/tests/should_succeed/vector/01.rs)
- [Binary search on Vectors](creusot/tests/should_succeed/vector/04_binary_search.rs)
- [Sorting a vector](creusot/tests/should_succeed/vector/02_gnome.rs)
- [IterMut](creusot/tests/should_succeed/iterators/02_iter_mut.rs)
- [Normalizing If-Then-Else Expressions](creusot/tests/should_succeed/ite_normalize.rs)

More examples are found in [creusot/tests/should_succeed](creusot/tests/should_succeed).

## Projects built with Creusot

- [CreuSAT](https://github.com/sarsko/creusat) is a verified SAT solver written in Rust and verified with Creusot. It really pushes the tool to its limits and gives an idea of what 'use in anger' looks like.
- Another big project is in the works :)

# Installing Creusot as a user

1. [Install `rustup`](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), to get the suitable Rust toolchain
2. [Get `opam`](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html), the package manager for OCaml
3. Clone the [creusot](https://github.com/creusot-rs/creusot/) repository,
   then *move into the `creusot` directory* for the rest of the setup.
    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/creusot-rs/creusot
    $ cd creusot
    ```
4. Set up **Why3** and **Why3find**. Create a local `opam` switch with why3:
   ```
   $ opam switch create -y . ocaml.4.14.1
   $ eval $(opam env)
   ```
   This will build `why3`, `why3find`, and their ocaml dependencies in a local `_opam` directory.
5. Install **Creusot**:
    ```
    $ cargo install --path cargo-creusot
    $ cargo creusot setup install
    ```
    The first command will build the `cargo-creusot` executable and place it in `~/.cargo/bin/`.
    The second command will download solvers (Alt-Ergo, Z3, CVC4, CVC5), configure Why3 to use them,
    then it will install the `creusot-rustc` executable; configuration files are stored in
    `~/.config/creusot/` and executables are stored in `~/.local/share/creusot/`.

# Upgrading Creusot 

1. Enter the cloned Creusot git repository used previously to install Creusot
2. Update Creusot's sources:
   ```
   $ git pull
   ```
2. Upgrade Why3 if needed:
   ```
   $ eval $(opam env)
   $ opam update
   $ opam pin . -y
   ```
3. Rebuild and reinstall Creusot:
   ```
   $ cargo install --path cargo-creusot
   ```
4. Re-run Creusot's setup:
   ```
   $ cargo creusot setup install
   ```
